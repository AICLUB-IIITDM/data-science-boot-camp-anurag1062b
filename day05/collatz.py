    What is COLLATZ SEQUENCE
    The Collatz sequence, also known as the 3n + 1 sequence, is a sequence of numbers defined as follows:
        Start with any positive integer n.
        Each subsequent term in the sequence is obtained from the previous term according to these rules:
        If the previous term is even, the next term is one-half of the previous term.
        If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
        Repeat the process indefinitely.
